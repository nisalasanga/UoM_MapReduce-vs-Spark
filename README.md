# MapReduce vs Spark
MapReduce and Spark are two popular technologies used for processing and analyzing large data sets. Both MapReduce and Spark are designed for distributed processing of large data sets. Here we are interested in comparing these Two technologies with run time and ease of use.

# MapReduce
The MapReduce is a model consists of several steps that are executed in sequence to process and generate large datasets in a parallel and distributed manner.
The MapReduce process is typically executed in a distributed computing environment, where multiple machines work together to process the input dataset. The framework manages the distribution of the input data, the execution of map and reduce tasks, and the communication between nodes in the cluster.
